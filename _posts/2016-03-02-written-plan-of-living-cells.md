The written plan of living cells is very large. Computers read these plans, but they are not very good at it. They read lots of small little bits of the written plan at a time, and that makes lots of problems. I make a computer thing that takes the small little bits of the written plan and puts them together into larger bits. People look through these larger bits, because it's easier than using the small bits, to look for interesting stuff in there and learn more about living cells.
