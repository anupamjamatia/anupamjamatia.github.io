[ABySS](https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss) is a genome sequence assembler that distributes the computation of large genome sequence assembly over a cluster of computers using MPI. ABySS was used assemble the twenty gigabase white spruce (*Picea glauca*) genome, seven times the size of the human genome.
