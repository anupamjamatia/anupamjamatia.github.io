The [SMarTForests](http://www.smartforests.ca/) project used [ABySS](https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss) to assemble the genome of white spruce (*Picea glauca*), which is twenty gigabases, seven times larger than the human genome. I also assembled and annotated the organellar genomes of white spruce, the chloroplast and mitochondrion.
